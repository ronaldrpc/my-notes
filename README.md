This project is a CRUD for notes, and is created in order to practice Django and Django Rest Framework.

Mostly of the project concerns to backend functionality. However we can find some Django templates.

In the future, this project will be use to practice docker and it'll be deployed in the cloud.

Pd: Because this project offers an API Rest, there will be a frontend service that consumes this backend.
